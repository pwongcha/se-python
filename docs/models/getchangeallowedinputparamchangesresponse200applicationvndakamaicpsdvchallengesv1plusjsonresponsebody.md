# GetChangeAllowedInputParamChangesResponse200ApplicationVndAkamaiCpsDvChallengesV1PlusJSONResponseBody

When using certificates with domain validation, you prove that you have control over each of the domains listed in the certificate. When you create a new DV enrollment that generates a certificate signing request (CSR), CPS automatically sends it to Let's Encrypt for signing. Let's Encrypt sends back a challenge for each domain listed on your certificate. You prove that you have control over the domains listed in the CSR by redirecting your traffic to Akamai. This allows Akamai to complete the challenge process for you by detecting the redirect and answering Let's Encrypt's challenge. You need to configure your web server to redirect your traffic to Akamai. If you aren't able to redirect traffic on your web server, you need to instruct the person who can redirect traffic to do so. Let's Encrypt automatically verifies the domain after it receives an answer to the challenge, and marks the domain as validated. A version label indicates this member is introduced in that version. A pre-version label indicates this member is removed in that version. No version label indicates this member is present in all versions.
